Jon Skeet - Party with C# like it's 2016


Look at pluralsight courses
- Initialize properties by default
- Properties can be properly readonly (only with getter - I kind of did this in DayWatch now ... )
- Properties can written as:
public type Property => expression;

and a method like 
method() => method expression body member;

- nameof operator ->  
 - returns string with the name of variable you pass to it
 - has about 3 uses
  - ArgumentException
  - RaisePropertyChanged
  - Attribute values - previously you would be able to get it from tree, but you were not able to do them it properties

Using static -> lets you import single types or members rather than whole namespace (so you eg. don't have to view unnecessary extensions)
Also with using static you can call static methods directly (without specifying the class - neat! )

String Interpolation
Sadly, does not work with our Team City
SI can you eg. conditional expressions ( (boo) ? : ) , as long as you put brackets around

FormattableString

Null conditional operator ?.
! ------------- >  To check - try to use it in DayWatch

Exception Filters


Some less usefull stuff
